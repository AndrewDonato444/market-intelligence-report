# Testing Learnings

Patterns for testing in this codebase.

---

## Mocking

<!-- Patterns for mocking dependencies, APIs, etc. -->

### 2026-03-09
- **Gotcha**: `jest.mock("@/path/to/module")` fails with "Could not locate module" if the file doesn't exist yet on disk. When writing tests before implementation (TDD), use local mock functions instead of `jest.mock` for modules that haven't been created yet.
- **Pattern**: For admin auth testing, mock `getAuthUserId` and `getProfile` separately, then test the composed `requireAdmin()` function. This lets you test all combinations (unauth, auth but no profile, auth but non-admin, admin).

---

## Assertions

<!-- Common assertion patterns, custom matchers -->

### 2026-03-09
- **Gotcha**: `@testing-library/jest-dom` must be explicitly imported (`import "@testing-library/jest-dom"`) in test files that use DOM matchers like `toHaveTextContent`, `toHaveAttribute`, `toBeInTheDocument`. Without it, these matchers throw "not a function" errors.
